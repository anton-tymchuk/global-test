# Multi level menu from JSON
This is a simple multi level menu that can be built from JSON file with pure JavaScript and CSS3.

To run example install all dependencies using $npm install, then run `$webpack` to rebuild existed bundle.js file and `$webpack-dev-server --inline` to start localhost.

Open http://localhost:8080/app in your browser and it should work just fine.
